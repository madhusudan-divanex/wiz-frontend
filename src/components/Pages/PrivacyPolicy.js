            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.

            <b>In Short:</b> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area
            (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you
            greater access to and control over your personal information. You
            may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
          </p>
          <h6>
            In some regions you have certain rights under applicable data
            protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access
            and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
            rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
            personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.
            In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to
            the processing of your personal information. To make such a request,
            please contact us and we will consider and act upon any request in
            accordance with applicable data protection laws.

            If we are relying on your consent to process your personal

            of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the
            processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
            lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you are a resident
            in the United Arab Emirates, EEA or UK and you believe we are
            unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
            right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
            authority.

          <h6>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data

            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
